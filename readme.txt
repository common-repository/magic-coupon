Pass a WooCommerce coupon code via URL and display the product prices as if the coupon has been applied to them. Coupon is automatically added to the cart alongside the products.

== Description ==

With this plugin, you can pass a coupon code via an URL parameter (`mcoupon` by default) and it will be stored in a cookie for a configurable amount of time.

While the cookie is valid:

* All the eligible products will have their display price reflect the coupon discount;
* A personalized HTML message can be shown on the product page, under the product price (or anywhere else, if you know your way around hooks);
* When the client adds the product to the cart, the coupon is automatically applied also;

Please note that the coupon can still be applied manually by the user at any time. This will not lock the coupon regular usage.

The support for variable products is experimental and may be moved to a premium add-on in the future.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the URL parameter name from `mcoupon` to something else? =

Yes. Use the `magic_coupon_url_parameter` filter.

= Can I show the HTML message somewhere else on the product page? =

Sure you can. Use the `magic_coupon_html_message_action_hook` filter to change the hook and the `magic_coupon_html_message_action_priority` filter to change the priority.

If you don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre talking about, you should probably stop now and [hire us](https://www.webdados.pt/contactos/) to do it for you :-)

You can also show it directly on the product description by using the `[magic_coupon_html_message]` shortcode.

= Is it possible to add dynamic information to the HTML message? =

You bet! Use one of the following placeholders on your message:

* `{product_id}` will be replaced by the Product ID;
* `{coupon}` will be replaced by the coupon code;
* `{cookie_expire_timestamp}` will be replaced by the cookie expiration Unix timestamp;
* `{cookie_validity_minutes}` will be replaced by the cookie validity in minutes;
* `{cookie_validity_hours_minutes}` will be replaced by the cookie validity in hours or minutes (in the `x hours` or `x minutes` format), depending on the validity being more or less than one hour;

You can also add you own placeholders with the `magic_coupon_html_message_replace_tags` filter. See an example [here](https://gist.github.com/webdados/c6094429e1e53306d767ee0b7255f4ea).

And because you can also use shortcodes on the HTML message field, you can feed the product id, coupon, the cookie expire timestamp or validity, or any other variable you set via your own placeholders as a shortcode argument, you can do whatever you want with your custom message. [Go crazy](https://gist.github.com/webdados/57682c9f7e4dad416f1ab0ec4b7476d5), or [hire us](https://www.webdados.pt/contactos/) to develop a custom solution for you.

= Can this plugin have issues with caching plugins? =

Yes. The page output has to be changed to set the discounted product prices based on the user cookie. That‚Äôs incompatible with a server-side caching system.

We set the following constants to prevent caching by some plugins, on the moment the customer reaches the page with a coupon code:

* `DONOTCACHEPAGE`
* `DONOTCACHEOBJECT`
* `DONOTCACHEDB`

This will ensure the page with the discounted price is not cached on that moment (and no other users will see a version of the page with the discount), but will not disable the cache that might already exist.

Anyway, we've experimented a bit with the [WP-Optimize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/) ‚ÄúCookies which, if present, will prevent caching‚Äù setting, by entering the name of our cookie (`mcoupon` by default), and we had good results. Regular users see the cached page and the ones with the coupon set on the cookie see non-cached pages.

= Is this plugin compatible with the new WooCommerce High-Performance Order Storage? =

Yes.

= Is this plugin compatible with the new WooCommerce block-based Cart and Checkout? =
